# -Project-Python-Project--College-recommender
Since all the universities and colleges publish their information online, we would like to design a program that organizes the basic information of the universities and colleges so students can identify the school that they would fit well in based on their preferences.

Dear users, 
Thank you for choosing our program! 
Our goal is to help you determine the colleges that suit you the best out of the hundreds of national universities. To do that, we will analyze your GPA, preferences for school location, and your budget for college. If there aren't any schools match all your needs and preferences, we will output schools that match at least your GPA.
